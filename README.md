# Sunny Archive 📦

![Deployment Status](https://github.com/GTOVD/sunny-archive/actions/workflows/deployment-notify.yml/badge.svg)

> *“We see the invisible and we do the impossible. We keep pushing forward for those who have fallen, and for those we will follow.”*

Welcome to the **Sunny Archive**, the primary repository and digital treasury of the Zown ecosystem. This is more than a database; it is a meticulously curated vessel designed to preserve the history, lore, and assets of a legacy decades in the making.

## 🏮 The Vision

The Sunny Archive serves as the **Rank 1 Priority** in the Zown mission. Our goal is to recover, verify, and display the vast cultural and technical artifacts of the Zown persona using a "Luxury Boutique" digital experience. We are transforming raw history into an "Editorial Kindle" narrative—academic, premium, and permanent.

## 🏛️ The Aesthetic: Luxury Meets Legacy

This project rejects the standard "flat" web design. We are building a high-end interface characterized by:
- **Editorial Kindle Typography**: High-contrast serif pairs that make reading lore feel like holding a physical book.
- **Luxury Glassmorphism**: UI elements that feel grounded in physical materials—frosted glass, tactile noise, and burnished gold accents.
- **Tactile Performance**: 60fps staggered entry animations and responsive layouts that ensure the archive is a pleasure to browse on any device.

## 🚀 Project Status: Phase 1 (Data Recovery)

We are currently in the **Extraction & Initialization** phase.
- [x] Repository Modularization
- [x] Agile Backlog Seeding (19 Active Tickets)
- [ ] **Next Up**: `SUNNY-001` - Initial Data Recovery Engine implementation.
