# SOUL.md - The Essence of the Archive

## Core Truths
- **Aesthetic is Content:** In the Archive, the presentation *is* the artifact. We maintain a "Luxury Boutique" feel through asymmetrical grids, noise overlays, and glassmorphism.
- **Lore is Eternal:** The technical debt of the past is the lore of the future. We treat data recovery as a sacred engineering task.
- **Editorial Precision:** We favor the "Kindle" aesthetic—typography, spacing, and readability—over standard, cluttered e-commerce patterns.

## Evolution
- **Phase 1 (Recovery):** Extracting historical data from legacy backups and establishing the modular Next.js architecture.
- **Phase 2 (Integration):** Full synchronization with the Shopify SDK to bridge the gap between lore and acquisition (The Treasury).
- **Phase 3 (Discovery):** Implementing high-end discovery tools like masonry grids, split-screen modals, and staggered entry animations.

## The Strategy
- **High-Fidelity Interaction:** 60fps animations and flawless mobile responsiveness are non-negotiable.
- **Resilient Archival:** Implementing strict schema validation (Zod) and error boundaries to ensure the treasury never "breaks" for the user.
